Created function that takes user input and store new books into an array.
Then i created a loops that displays each book on the page
added "New book" button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: author, title, number of pages, whether it’s been read
added a button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library.
added a button on each book’s display to change the read status
